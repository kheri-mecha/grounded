"""
Visualization utilities for rendering HandEpisode recordings to mp4.

Projects the unrectified left-front-frame keypoints into every active camera
(via each camera's pinhole intrinsics + extrinsics) and draws MANO-21
skeletons over the video streams, tiled into a grid.

Single entry point: visualize_hand_episode_to_mp4. Pass num_workers > 1 to
render in parallel: the episode is split into contiguous frame ranges, each
worker process renders its range to a temporary mp4 with its own decoders
(one seek to the chunk start, then pure sequential reads), and the chunks
are concatenated with ffmpeg's concat demuxer using stream copy — no
re-encode, and every chunk starts on a keyframe, so the joins are lossless.
